Sensor Agent Percepts Report for Lab 2

The SensorAgent continuously monitors a simulated environment with multiple areas. 
Each area can experience disasters such as floods, fires, and earthquakes. 
The agent generates random severity levels from 0 to 10 for each disaster type, representing the intensity of the event. 
These percepts are logged with timestamps, providing a record of the environmental state. 
In a more advanced multi-agent system, these percepts could guide decision-making and responses to disasters.
